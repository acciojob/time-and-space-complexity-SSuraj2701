	<h1>My fisrt heading tag is of Time,Space,and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity,efficient is a way to describe how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It's a measure of an algorithm's efficiency, helping to understand how it will perform with different amounts of data</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run as a function of the input size is Space Complexity, O(n)</p>
